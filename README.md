Branch Design Challenge: What was the most challenging part of designing the conversation branches? Did you discover anything about how voice agents handle different conversation paths?
When designing the conversation branches it actually wasnt to difficult due to the clear distinct paths I made inbetween agents. This distinct path allowed for the agents to have a clear understanding of which agent to send the user to.
Knowledge Base Impact: How did the knowledge base content you added affect the agent's responses? Did certain types of content work better than others?
The knowledge base was extremely important and helpful that it was as accurate and clear as possible. For the nutrition hours I had to manually input the text into the knowledge base which worked way better.
Real-World Application: What real-world application could this voice agent have? Think about a specific industry, business, or use case where this type of agent would be valuable.
The real world application that I used was for a local gym that I go to. So this agent already benefits me in a real world scenario by asnwering questions about the gym and FAQ's about said gym.
